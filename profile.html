    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of cats that roam the castle, but I'm the most important one. I help my owner catch disobedient students, and my favorite student to tattle on is Harry Potter.</p>

 <h2>My Skills</h2>
 <p>I have a variety of skills. These skills include:
    <ul>
        <li>Seeing better than stupid dogs</li>
        <li>Hearing better than stupid dogs</li>
        <li>Having a larger vocabulary than stupid dogs</li>
        <li>Having better balance and finesse than stupid dogs</li>
        <li>Being a lot cleaner than stupid dogs</li>
        <li>Being better than stupid dogs in every possible way</li>
      </ul>
    <p> I also have  a special skillset that allows me to wander the castle halls abnormally fast and to call my owner from anywhere he may be in the castle, all in the name of keeping Hogwarts safe. </p>

    <p>Did I miss anything?</p>

 <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
 <p>I am currently helping Filch with the protection of the students, but one day I aim to be the only cat in the castle. I will get rid of all the other pesky animals around here, excpet for maybe the rats because they're fun to chase. And I suppose Professor McGonagall can stay.</p>
